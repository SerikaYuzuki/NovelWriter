# v2 Docker and database namespace

The development deployment is a new Compose project/service revision that
mounts one named data volume for v2 PostgreSQL. The edge service additionally
uses two named Caddy state volumes; those are not database or application
data authorities:

```text
API prefix:       /v2
PostgreSQL volume fuminiwa_sync_v2_pgdata
auth schema:      auth_v1 (separate schema namespace)
sync schema:      sync_v2 (separate schema namespace)
object bytes:     sync_v2.global_blobs.raw_bytes BYTEA
```

The checked-in Compose file currently bootstraps both schemas with one
PostgreSQL role. Separate database owners/roles are a staging hardening gate,
not a capability claimed by this Compose revision; deployment evidence must
include role grants and authenticated read-back before that claim is restored.

It does not mount a v1 PostgreSQL volume, legacy object directory, package
root, or CloudKit credential. Startup fails if the configured database lacks
the v2 schema checksum/protocol epoch or points at a known v1 volume/schema.
The live service never runs an archive migration automatically.

`PostgresObjectStore` is the only initial `ObjectStore` implementation. A
future S3 adapter requires a new versioned deployment manifest, data-copy plus
read-back migration, rollback evidence, and a later Decision. It is not an
ambient environment-variable switch in this deployment.
